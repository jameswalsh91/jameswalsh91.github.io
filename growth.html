From my first day to my last, TU/e has been full of exciting new experiences and lessons. At the beginning of the semester I set out my goals of wanting to learn programming, and furthering my knowledge about user experience design. By undertaking the craft stories project, as well as the Creative programming assignment, I can confidently say that the lessons I've learnt have put me in good stead for developing my skills in the future in regards to electronics and programming. By undertaking the assignment Designing for the User Experience, I also felt that this class could assist me in understanding the different methodologies I could adapt to my user testing, and understanding human behaviour in regards to objects and systems design. Purchasing my first Arduino Uno was both exciting and horrifying. Opening up the starter box and seeing a collection of tiny components that id never used before made me wish id payed more attention in high school electronics. With only minor hiccups I was able to command my LED to blink, and was soon exploring the remaining contents with a gradual success rate. At the research phase of my project I was looking into moving structures, and wanted to generate a pattern that would create a visual and tactile experience for the user. It seemed there were a few options for creating moving forms, two of which that I stumbled upon required a servo motor which seemed very cumbersome and the other being muscle wire. After using muscle wire I was incredibly underwhelming, and seemed that to achieve the desired reaction was near impossible, or required an amount of electrical energy that would burn out the material in the process. My exploration into servo motors was unfortunately limited as my direction of concept shifted, but I still managed to experiment to the point of controlling the servo with a potentiometer. With further development into my concept, a shift from tactile movement to a visual experience was formed which meant alternative means of input and output were explored. Thinking in a visual sense of sound and music made me look into audio visualisers and in doing so made me start to hate the overuse of projectors and laser shows that is notorious in the music scene. Over the course of the semester I managed to undergo a tutorial on Ableton that was held by a student, and I also managed to explore some basics with Max MSP. Both these programs are used in the production and visualisation of Midi sounds, and after seeing the potential of what can be achieved I was further inspired to explore how I could visualise sound in a new fashion. Working with ferrofluid and electromagnets was the last challenge I had to face, for the completion of my project. Developing electromagnets and experimenting with consistencies of the fluid was the fun part, the difficult part for me was combining these components with the electronics and processing. Despite the knowledge I had attained in my Creative Programming assignment, there were still issues revolving around electronics that I could not understand on my own, so turning to people in my group for assistance. When building an electronic circuit and working with the components, I came to realise that me and electronics do not mix very well. As my mathematical skills have not been visited for some time, it seemed it was rather difficult to grasp some of the formulas that the people at D-search would be trying to explain. Aside from this I found it rather interesting in learning about how the components of a circuit function, and was amazed at seeing how something so small that I was able to produce could create such a response. After experimenting with programming and electronics I discovered that these are difficult skills to master, but being a master at this stage is not necessary since there is so much information on the Internet that can cater specifically to the project you might be working on. Despite this only being my first few months of exploration into the world of coding and Arduino, I feel that these skills will be something that I will continue to work on in the future, as they genuinely interest me. After seeing what I've been able to achieve in the space of a few months, I feel as though many of the beautiful interactive designs that I've come to love and be inspired by, are explained in terms of programming and electronics. This new knowledge makes me feel as though many of my ideas aren’t so unrealistic as once thought, and I feel as though many previous boundaries that help me back from pursuing these avenues have been broken. TRAVELS
Before coming to Europe I knew I would be in for an adventure, but nothing could have prepared me for the places I've seen, the people I've met and the things I've learnt. From a Russian bartender in Hamburg expressing her fear to me as she’d just been told that her cancer had returned, to fish jumping out of the sea while waiting for the next wave in Carcavelos, Portugal. This expedition has taught me that people are incredibly nice, and incredibly ruthless. That the most familiar street can turn into a foot chase between you and your mugger, and that any landscape can be a exciting scenery. Traveling has taught me many things, but I feel that the most important lesson has been to enjoy the little things in life. Like biking home from university with a few friends, to lying in the sun when it finally decides to shine in Eindhoven. These small fleeting moments have made up some of my strongest memories, and has made me realise that no matter how much we want something to last, everything in life is beautiful due to its volatility.
